# randomize.rb

randomize.rb is a dead simple Ruby script that reads from STDIN until EOF and then writes out the lines in random order. If find myself using this kind of thing every once in a while, so I figured I should write a reusable script for it.

This is such a dead simple thing that I don't really expect or plan to do any major maintenance work on it.

## Installation

Obviously you can install this in different ways (or not do it at all). Personally, I have `randomize.rb` somewhere in my home folder, and symlink `/usr/local/bin/randomize` to it.
